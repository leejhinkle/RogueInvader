The door hisses open as the pod entry unfolds. You look out and see a bleak landscape, covered only by occasional rocks and leafless trees. In the far distance, you see one of those outposts made by those damned zenos.

“How the hell did I end up here?” The question runs unbidden through your mind. You know the facts.

Chosen to represent the terran colonies, the First Fleet was order by the Galactic Council to end the zeno war. You, all your friends, and a billion other soldiers and support crew jumped daily for the last 10 months to arrive here, to stamp out the zeno homeworld, and end the threat to peaceful life. 

But the zenos fought every step of the way. In those ten months, every supply ship, every ship with invasion pods, and most of the naval dreadnoughts, cruisers, and battleships were destroyed along the way. Only a million terrans remain able to invade. And there’s only one pod left to invade with. 

Somehow, you lived. Somehow--against all odds--your ship made it. 

And today, your number was drawn. Today, you entered the only invasion pod left on the GCS Gate of Valhalla to drop to the planet, exit the pod, watch it ascend back to the safety of the Valhalla’s launch bay, and then turn and wear down the zeno defenses, making it easier for the next marine to fight her way alone to the Throne Room and kill King Zeno to end the war. 

Today, you are the Rogue Invader.
